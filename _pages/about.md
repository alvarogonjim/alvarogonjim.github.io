I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Sevilla](https://www.us.es/), followed by a Master's degree in Informatics from [Grenoble INP](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/), where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/). During my studies, I gained valuable experience as a research intern at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr) and [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/).

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Basel, where I am co-supervised by [Marc Pouly](https://marcpouly.ch/) and [Alexander Navarini](https://www.drnavarini.ch/de/). My research focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques in dermatology, with an emphasis on developing accessible methods for learning from noisy and limited data.

My broader research interests include generative modeling, hyperbolic geometry, and the robustness of machine learning systems.
