**Previously** I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Sevilla](https://www.us.es/). Following that, I pursued a Master's degree in Science in Informatics at [Grenoble INP](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/) under the guidance of [Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/). During my academic journey, I had the privilege of working as a research intern at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr) and [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/).

**Currently:** Ph.D. student at the University of Basel, co-supervised by [Marc Pouly]() and [Alexander Navarini](). My research revolves around applying machine learning techniques to dermatology, with a specific emphasis on developing accessible methods for learning with limited data. I'm driven to leverage generative modeling to enhance clinical images, reducing bias, improving model robustness, and transforming skin tones into richer representations.

By creating accurate and inclusive models, my ultimate goal is to enhance patient outcomes and diminish healthcare disparities in dermatology. Working at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, I'm enthusiastic about tackling challenges and developing innovative solutions that benefit individuals from diverse backgrounds.
